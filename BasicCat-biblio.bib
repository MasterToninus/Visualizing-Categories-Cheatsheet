@book{Borceux1994,
abstract = {The Handbook of Categorical Algebra is designed to give, in three volumes, a detailed account of what should be known by everybody working in, or using, category theory. As such it will be a unique reference. The volumes are written in sequence. This third volume turns to topos theory and the idea of sheaves. The theory of locales is considered first, and Grothendieck toposes are introduced. Notions of sketchability and accessible categories are discussed, and an axiomatic generalization of the category of sheaves is given.There is ample material here for a graduate course in category theory, and the book should also serves as a reference for users.},

@book{Strecker2004,
abstract = {This up-to-date introductory treatment employs category theory to explore the theory of structures. Its unique approach stresses concrete categories and presents a systematic view of factorization structures, offering a unifying perspective on earlier work and summarizing recent developments. Numerous examples, ranging from general to specific, illuminate the text. 1990 edition, updated 2004.},
